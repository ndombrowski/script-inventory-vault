# Script Inventory

This obsidian vault contains categorized various bioinformatic workflows, scripts and one-liners.

## Categories

- [[workflow_management]]: Script examples for job scheduling, batch processing, and parallel execution
- [[quality_control]]: Scripts for quality control and sanity checks
- [[data_processing]]: Scripts for data cleaning and transformation 
- [[visualization]]: Scripts for generating plots and visualization
- [[utilities]]: Helper scripts for file I/O, logging, and other tasks
- [[pipeline_scripts]]:  Workflow automation scripts for common pipelines
- [[tutorials]]: Mostly links to useful tutorials but can also be tutorials for some workflows in r, python, etc.
- The **example folder** includes some example workflows from various projects

## Finding things

- Browse the categories for a list of all scripts per category
- Use the search bar or tags to find scripts by keyword or category.
- Inside the vault, run `python scripts/utilities/search_scripts.py` and provide a search term to search the [[index.json]] file. At the moment this allows to search scripts but not snippets

## Adding new content

1. Save the script in the appropriate folder under `scripts/`.
2. Add a new section for the script in the relevant category-based document (e.g., `data_processing.md`).
3. Add the script to the [[index.json]].
4. Link the script to relevant categories and examples.
